<a name="welcome-to-personal-wire" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-personal-wire"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Personal Wire.</h3>

<p>Personal Wire is a tool that makes it simple to use social medial (Twitter, Facebook, Blogs etc) to market yourself as a photographer. </p>

<p>At the end of a shoot, all you have to do is export the photos you want to post online into a folder on your computer. On Monday, Personal Wire will post your first picture to your blog, to Facebook, to Twitter. On Wednesday it will post your second picture to the same places. On Friday your third picture. </p>

<p>It's as simple as:</p>

<ol>
<li>Export the photos you want to post online to a folder on your computer</li>
<li>There is no step 2</li>
</ol><p>Regularly posting your photos on various social media sites is important because it keeps presenting your best work to your potential customers. It establishes you as a photographer capable of reliably delivering high quality photos. </p>

<p>But this is a boring task. Plus if you are out on a shoot or on holiday you can't be at the computer posting things online. I tried using several existing bits of software to automate the problem, but nothing really did what I wanted. Either it reduced the photo quality, or didn't let me choose when to post the photos. So I write my own.</p>

<p>That means it's free to download it, run it, use it or modify it. Unfortunately it does mean that if you're not comfortable programming a computer it probably isn't for you. But don't worry, read the next section. </p>

<p>If you are comfortable writing computer programs, and want to help out by adding some code, please feel free to do so. </p>

<p>If you're not comfortable doing things like setting up web servers and creating Facebook apps, but think the idea is useful enough that you would be willing to pay $5-$10/month to use it, enter your email address below. If enough people are interested I'll set it up as an online service. (If that doesn't work you can let me know you're interested by <a href="http://eepurl.com/IBFnL">clicking here</a>.)</p>
