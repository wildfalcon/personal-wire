<a name="welcome-to-personal-wire" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-personal-wire"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is it?</h3>

<p>Personal Wire is a tool that makes it simple to use social medial (Twitter, Facebook, Blogs etc) to share your photos as part of your online marketing. </p>

<p>Just export the photos you want to share into a folder on your computer. On Monday, Personal Wire will post your first picture to your blog, to Facebook, to Twitter. On Wednesday it will post your second picture to the same places. On Friday your third picture. </p>

<p>Once it's set up (<a href="https://github.com/wildfalcon/personal-wire/blob/master/README.md#installation">instructions here</a> or if thats too complex <a href="#but-im-not-a-programmer">let me know you want it a subscription service</a>), then it's as simple as:</p>

<ol>
<li>Export the photos you want to post online to a folder on your computer</li>
<li>There is no step 2</li>
</ol>

<h3>How and why would I use it</h3>

<p>You've just come back from a shoot. You've loaded up all your photos into Lightroom (or Aperture, or anything really), sorted them, captioned them, tagged them, edited them, got your final set and you've sent the pics off to the client.</p>

<p>But you're not done yet. Now you want to use some of the shots on your Facebook profile, and on your blog, and you want to tweet about them, and post them on Flickr. You know, all the cool places that photographers show off their work these days to try and attract clients and build a reputation. Man, thats a lot of work. Its not difficult, but it's time consuming.</p> 

<p>It's even more of a pain if you want to post them slowly: one every few days. Which is what you really want to be doing so that your pictures keep popping up and establish your name in peoples minds. It would be so much easier to just upload them all in one go and be done with it, but that won't have the effect you want. </p>

<p>That's where personal wire comes in. Simply export your photos into a folder, and then forget about it. Personal Wire will fetch them from your folder, store them and then, at the right time post them for you, all without any need for you to get involved. It will even extract the captions from.</p> 

<p>You get to spend your time doing the things that only you can do. Things like actually interacting your fans on Twitter and Facebook, or going out and taking more photos.</p>

<p>That means it's free to download it, run it, use it or modify it. Unfortunately it does mean that if you're not comfortable programming a computer it probably isn't for you. But don't worry, read the next section. </p>

<p>If you are comfortable writing computer programs, and want to help out by adding some code, please feel free to do so. </p>

<p>If you're not comfortable doing things like setting up web servers and creating Facebook apps, but think the idea is useful enough that you would be willing to pay $5-$10/month to use it, enter your email address below. If enough people are interested I'll set it up as an online service. (If that doesn't work you can let me know you're interested by <a href="http://eepurl.com/IBFnL">clicking here</a>.)</p>
